## ﻿Adversarial Attack on CIFAR 10
* VGG16 trained from scratch (random initialization) for 10-class classification. 
* Accuracy (overall and class wise) on the testing set reported.
* FGSM attack is performed
* Reported Structural Similarity Index : The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) is a perceptual metric that quantifies image quality degradation* caused by processing such as data compression or by losses in data transmission. It is a full reference metric that requires two images from the same image capture— a reference image and a processed image.
* Accuracy before and after attack compared.
* JPEG compression with different compression rates on perturbed images is performed.
